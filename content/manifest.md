As someone who finds that my work and efforts are best appreciated by myself
when I have a tangible ambition to work with and develop meaningful
technologies, creating a manifest document has been greatly beneficial to my
personal development.

A manifest, besides being a common file included in software distributions which
handles identifying which files should be registered to which software
components, is somewhat of a mission statement. In a sense, a manifest like
this serves the same purpose for a brain as the corresponding manifest serves a
piece of software. That is to say, it puts a purpose to actions that one knows
must be completed in order to get to a completed state.

## My Mission

**I will design software which is elegant, user-centric, modular-by-default,
and serves a clear purpose, with the aim of creating tools which usher in a new
era of sustainable human living** Above all, every individual on planet earth
deserves a chance to lead a life that is as free from the pains, struggles, and
wastefulness of our living as we have found ourselves today---in as sustainable
a fashion as we can.

## Purpose of the Mission
The mission above seeks to provide a key point of guidance, especially in
situations where the decision-making is intense, energy-consuming, and tiring.
It provides a way of resolving which way to go when you've reached a fork in the
road. It provides a method to understanding whether I am going to be more or
less likely to succeed in future roles. And, it provides a method of first
thinking-twice, then doing once, something that has occasionally proven
difficult for me.

As such, by clearly delineating the purpose of the mission, we hope to hold
ourselves more accountable to the intentions here, for despite what some people
may think, intentions do, in-fact, matter.

## The Mission: In Practice
All of this so far is a bit theoretical. In practice, I want this manifest to
serve my development as a programmer and critical thinker in the following ways:
