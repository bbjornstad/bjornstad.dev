# PGP Keys

These are my public PGP keys. If desired, email communications sent to me can be
end-to-end encrypted using these keys. I mostly use them for identity
verification purposes, e.g. as a password and 2-factor authentication tool, or for
signing emails or github commits.

I use Yubikeys for 2-FA whenever possible, and as such there
are a few different options. [Read more here](tags/yubikey). While you probably
want the first of these options, all are included here for "posterity".

I simply note here that I reserve the right to discontinue the use of some keys,
either due to security issues or because I want to adjust the configuration of
my yubikeys.
