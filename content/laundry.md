# Dirty Laundry and Anti-User Practices in the Internet Era

This is simply a short list of practices that businesses seem to have started
using, which I find to be abhorrent and should be illegal. I'm no lawyer, but as
an internet user, these practices fly in the face of the user's best interest and
pander to the wants of corporate money-grubbing.

## Insecure Practices

I disagree with these practices because they require compromising the user's
security configuration to be able to use features of the base service.

*   Blocking VPN Users. This has become and increasingly common practice on the
    internet, and it feels like asking a sexual partner not to use a condom...which
    is to say, very sleazy.
*   Preventing users from using 2-FA without paying for a premium plan.
*   Not having any 2-FA at all. The best practice is to allow the user to access
    TOTP codes as a backup method to full hardware-security key based
    authentication, although many websites only accept phone numbers for TOTP
    authentication, which is an insecure practice itself.

## Plain Being an Asshole, and Abusing the User-Base

*   Charging exorbitant fees for third-parties to be able to use a service API,
    especially when these parties had already developed applications to integrate
    with the API in question (read: [Reddit](https://reddit.com/)).
*   Generally, the matter of service enshittification. This is not exclusively a
    Reddit issue, to be sure. Others have spoken at length about this, I do not
    wish to rehash their arguments for what should be a pretty obvious position:
    don't kill good products for profit and corporate greed. It should be
    possible to run a sustainable business while simultaneously allowing for success
    without capitalizing on the common user-base or the world's abundant natural
    resources (especially those on foreign soil).
*   Arbitrarily imposed limits on user behavior, even when the underlying
    feature is free other very-low-cost relative to general business spending.
    (example: Spotify allows users only 4 pinned items on their profile).
