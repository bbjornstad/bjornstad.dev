# Dirty Laundry in the Internet and Anti-User Practices Era

This is simply a short list of practices that businesses seem to have started
using, which I find to be abhorrent and should be illegal. I'm no lawyer, but as
an internet user, these practices fly in the face of the user's best interest and
pander to the wants of corporate money-grubbing.

## Insecure Practices

These practices I disagree with because they require compromising the user's
security configuration to be able to use the base service.

*   Blocking VPN Users
*   Preventing users from using 2-FA without paying for a premium plan
*   Not having any 2-FA at all. The best practice is to allow the user to access
    TOTP codes by phone as a backup method to full hardware-backed security key
    authentication as the primary (I use Yubico products but NitroKey is also
    popular.)

## Plain Being an Asshole, and Abusing the Userbase

*   Charging exorbitant fees for third-parties to be able to use a service API,
    especially when these parties had already developed applications to integrate
    with the API in question (read: [reddit](https://reddit.com/)).
*   Generally, the matter of service enshittification. This is not exclusively a
    Reddit issue, to be sure. Others have spoken at length about this, I do not
    wish to rehash their arguments for what should be a pretty obvious position:
    don't kill good products for profit and corporate greed.
*   Arbitrarily imposed limits on user behavior, even when the underlying
feature is free other very-low-cost relative to general business practices.
(example: Spotify, after rollout of playlist folders, allows users only 4 pinned
items on their profile).
