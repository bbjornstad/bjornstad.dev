# Professional Experience

## unumAI ()

*   Data Engineer, Data Management Specialist, Business Intelligence Developer,
    and General Purpose Programming for Solving Problems.
*   Technical lead during the initial stages of startup phase.
*   Implemented a custom framework in Python directly from technical specification
    for continued analysis of Google Trends data to identify and predict election
    outcomes in the United States.
*   Used Azure tooling at minimal cost to integrate asynchronous processing of
    Google Trends data for analysis and storage in an Azure Data Lake.
*   Helped explain some of the more technical aspects of the project
    to non-technical stakeholders, or curious observers.

## Bright Event Rentals

*   Data Engineer, Data Management Specialist, CyberQuery and Database Wrangler.
*   Helped achieve significant cost-savings on rental equipment maintenance and protection.
*   Generally helped the company get a better handle on its data and how to use it
    to make better decisions by providing authored queries that saved time in the
    office from fighting the database software.

# Projects and Open-Source

## `dotcandyd`

*   A personal dotfiles and configuration manager written in Rust.
*   Core components include a bare-git repository tracking a work-tree index,
    typically the $HOME folder for the user.
*   Inspired-templating approach using Rust's Tera templates.
*   A definite work in progress for nowâ€¦rust is a deep language so far and while
    I can tell that its power is great, I'm still learning how to wield it.
*   Don't rely on it to do anything yet.
*   Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbjornstad/dotcandyd).

## Rising Sines

*   DJing and multimedia entertainment project.
*   What started as a simple late-night radio show on Northwestern's very own
    WNUR 89.3 FM has grown into a full-fledged multimedia entertainment project.
    The eventual goal is to have an online space that allows free sharing of
    multimedia content, especially around music or other forms of artistic
    expression. This would include a platform for supporting creators in a
    manner of ways (crypto tokens being the easiest/most straightforward top
    implement) while not tying this support to access to the multimedia.
*   Website launching soon at [risingsines.live](https://risingsines.live).

## Other Open-Source Contributions

*   I admit I don't have any current contributions to open-source projects that I
    can point to, but I aim to contribute soon when
    I've settled on more concrete projects.
*   I've been using Linux for over 10 years now. I'm
    passionate about the open-source community and the work that it does to keep
    the world moving forward with reasonable enough standards behind technical
    issues that should absolutely be based in reality and user-transparency.
*   If you have other projects that you suggest I might help contribute towards,
    please contact me.
