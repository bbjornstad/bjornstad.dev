    Business Intelligence Developer, and General Purpose Programming for Solving

# Projects and Open-Source

- [`dotcandyd`](https://github.com/bbjornstad/dotcandyd): _--WIP--_ A personal
    dotfiles and configuration manager written by me in Rust. The core
    components are a bare-git repository tracking a work-tree index which is
    typically the $HOME folder for the user, together with a inspired-templating
    approach using Rust's Tera templates, much like the templates used to create
    the website you are currently reading. More information is available on
    GitHub.
- [Rising Sines](https://risingsines.live): _website forthcoming in the nearish
    future_. *fka* _Chowbungus_: DJing and Multimedia Entertainment Project.
