# Professional Experience

  for continued analysis of Google Trends data to identify and predict election outcomes in the United States.

  Google Trends data for analysis and storage in an Azure Data Lake.

# Projects and Open-Source

## `dotcandyd`

- A personal dotfiles and configuration manager written in Rust.
- Core components include a bare-git repository tracking a work-tree index, typically the $HOME folder for the user.
- Inspired-templating approach using Rust's Tera templates.
- A definite work in progress for now...rust is a deep language so far and while
  I can tell that its power is great, I'm still learning how to wield it.
- Don't rely on it to do anything quite yet.
- Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/bbjornstad/dotcandyd).

## Rising Sines

- DJing and multimedia entertainment project.
- What started as a simple late-night radio show on Northwestern's very own WNUR 89.3 FM has grown into a full-fledged multimedia entertainment project. The eventual goal is to have an online space that allows free sharing of multimedia content, especially around music or other forms of artistic expreession. This would include a platform for supporting creators in a manner of ways (crypto tokens being the easiest/most straightforward top implement) while not tying this support to access to the multimedia.
- Website launching soon at [risingsines.live](https://risingsines.live).

## Other Open-Source Contributions
- I admit I don't have any current contributions to open-source projects that I
  can point to, but I aim to contribute soon when 
  I've settled on more concrete projects.
- I've been using Linux for over 10 years now and I'm
  passionate about the open-source community and the work that it does
