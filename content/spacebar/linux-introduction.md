_author's note: the above does not represent the legitimate viewpoints of the US
Government, as I am not them, nor would I ever want to be. I would suggest that
concerned parties can take matters up with either President Biden
(prezie@whitehouse.gov) and/or their local embassies (????@????????.gov)._

Yep, that's right folks. You heard it here first. The US Government actually
**hates** Microsoft Windows, and Uncle Sam wants YOU to switch to Linux. And, for once, it
seems to be the case that I agree with a decision that the US government has made
in the past 20 years.

At one point, early in my college experience, I was running into some trouble
with Windows on my custom-buit pc. While the machine was old, it was running
without terrible driver performance hiccups, sound underrun/overrun events, and
other malfunctioning components that required maintenance of a _bespoke_
quality.

Over the following fateful week, my machine basically just gave
out completely. This was not going to fly for a college freshman. For a
multitude of reasons, I needed a computer for my mathematics studies (the
primary was to be able to use Vim to edit LaTeX files for math homework
writeups). I certainly didn't have enough money for a new system, but still
needed an effective computer and the hardware that I had sitting there was
apparently broken, but much more powerful than anything I could dream up for a
laptop (ok, probably not _anything_).

Enter Linux, Arch Linux to be exact. I had some previous experience with other
distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora on virtual machine instances, CentOS
through some bioinformatics projects I was involved in throuh UCSD, and a random
smattering of possibilities picked from [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com).
Personally, none of that managed to stick for me. It took until Arch Linux for
that elusive mental "click" to occur.

I chalk it up, ultimately, to the project ethos: KISS, or Keep it Simple,
Stupid. Whenever I recall times when mental patterns tend to stick
strongly, and where the end-product seems to carry more weight than it would
appear based on the constituent components, I note that those moments are
punctuated by a clean-configuration setup and a simple interface. Moreover, I
think that Arch, while being opinionated at the top, more general level of sound
processing, does not prescribe certain implementations, moreso than other
distributions. In other terms, opinionated decisions are made to guide the
project forward with good foundations, but the user is still afforded a great
deal of freedom and flexibility to handle system problems or adjust behavior.

Maybe we generally have earned our reputation amongst Linux users, as the
bona-fide vegans of the Linux scene. As the saying goes, you will always know
when you're talking to an arch Linux user, and now here you are reading my first
blog post...about arch Linux.
