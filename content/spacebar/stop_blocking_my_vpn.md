I don't know why I have to say this in the year 2023...I was even a little bit
optimistic that we might just get to skip this part of our internet progression,
but alas, no.

If you are a company who chooses to block a user's access to your website
because that user chooses to use extra services such as VPNs, external DNS
resolvers, or other methods that serve to increase protection when browsing
online, just cut that shit out. Like, yesterday.

I don't even use a vpn because I'm trying to evade your money grubbing paws and
your behavioral and identification algorithms, because I doubt a VPN even offers
that much protection in these circumstances. Rather, these are component
elements to a more holistic view of browsing the internet, that does ultimately
involve affording myself protections over what I would like to keep safe and in
my ownership. There are a great many actors on the internet--technological
dispersion issues aside, the whole world *should* have unfettered access to the
internet (in my ideal view). With such a large audience, you would only be
foolish to not afford yourself at least the understanding of reasonable risks,
especially if you have seen the same progression of the internet that I have.

The reality of the internet now is that there has been a proliferation in the
number of these bad actors, either ones whose purpose is something mundane, like "only"
stealing your email password, or ones with much more nefarious intent. Running
internet traffic through a VPN is not a catch-all solution to these problems,
but when integrated with a stack of additional protections, it can help to make
a machine a less tempting target for an adversary.

So when you decide that your website, application service, or internet content
should not be accessible without *the user* making a conscious choice to
downgrade a method of personal protection, I'm immediately looking for
alternatives to whatever crap you're probably peddling. It's lazy, it's
anti-consumer, it's annoying as hell, and frankly, you all, as
the providers of the services and ultimately their profiteers, should be more
than capable of figuring out a workable solution without needing to ask any
users for such a transgressive policy change.
