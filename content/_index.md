# Hi, I'm Bailey Bjornstad.

You seem to have found your way to my personal website for data engineering and
business intelligence. This is also home to __*[the spacebar](spacebar)*__, my
mostly-serious blog related to programming, Linux, math, and the occasional
rant (directed, misdirected, and undirected varieties now included, as part of a
nutritious breakfast).

Welcome. I hope that you enjoy your stay.

## bulletin - news, announcements
You are on the first version of this website. Minor bugs are likely to be
expected while the full site structure is fleshed out. Please [contact me](contact)
if you would like to report a bug or new issue with this site's operation.

## about

I am a data and software engineer with a background in mathematics from
Northwestern University. I harbor a deep love of computers, mathematical
elegance, functional simplicity, and the common wealth of knowledge that humans
have amassed through our impressive (and impressively messy) era on Planet
Earth.

I also really like Linux. You will (eventually) find a lot of posts about it, as
I hope to share some of my experiences dealing with some setbacks and
compromises that come with the freedom that Linux affords over the past
near-decade of my using the platform in its various flavors. Head over to [the
spacebar](spacebar) for the latest content (try sorting through tags).

On a good day, you might find me DJing, attending a concert, snowboarding,
hiking, cooking, or perhaps even playing a game (*gasp*). My brain seems to
operate like a computer, perhaps more than most, but even despite this fact,
it is hard to overstate the importance of time spent watching the birds change
from season to season, of noticing how trees sprout, mature, and eventually
pass away (ideally, long after any of us remain on this planet to observe). To
notice these things is to acknowledge the great equilibrium that binds all life
on Earth to their particular surroundings, their circumstances, and the very
inner workings of our fabric of space-time, even as yet not discovered.

With that, I am going to leave you here with one of my favorite thematically
relevant characters from a TV series: [Wan Shi Tong](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Wan_Shi_Tong)

![Wan Shi Tong - "He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things", The Infinite Librarian, Keeper of Knowledge, All-Powerful Owl](wanshitong.jpg)

Now off you go. Hopefully to enjoy the rest of the content here, but who am I
kidding, you are probably already weirded out!
