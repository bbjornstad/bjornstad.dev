# hi, I'm bailey bjornstad.

You seem to have found your way to my personal website for data engineering for
business intelligence. This is also home to __*the spacebar*__, my personal blog
related to programming, Linux, math, and the occasional rant.

Welcome, and I hope that you enjoy your stay.

## about

I am a data and software engineer with a background in mathematics from
Northwestern University. I harbor a deep love of computers, mathematical
elegance, functional simplicity, and the common wealth of knowledge that humans
have amassed through our era on Planet Earth.

I also really like Linux. You will (eventually) find a lot of posts about it, as
I hope to share some of my experiences dealing with some of the setbacks that
come with the total freedom that Linux affords over the past decade of my using
the platform in various flavors.
