# Hi, I'm Bailey Bjornstad.

![Bailey Bjornstad](bjornstad-profile-square.jpg)

You seem to have found your way to my personal website for data engineering and
business intelligence. This is also home to __*[the spacebar](spacebar)*__, my
mostly serious blog related to programming, Linux, math, and the occasional
rant (directed, misdirected, and undirected varieties now included, as part of a
nutritious breakfast).

Welcome. I hope that you enjoy your stay.

## about

I am a data and software engineer with a background in mathematics from
Northwestern University. I harbor a deep love of computers, mathematical
elegance, functional simplicity, and the common wealth of knowledge that humans
have amassed through our impressive (and impressively messy) era on Planet
Earth.

I also really like Linux. You will (eventually) find a lot of posts about it, as
I hope to share some of my experiences dealing with some setbacks and
compromises that come with the freedom that Linux affords over the past
near-decade of my using the platform in its various flavors. Head over to [the
spacebar](spacebar) for the latest content (try sorting through tags).
