# Hi, I'm Bailey Bjornstad.

{% image_homeprofile(path="bjornstad-profile-square.jpg", width=270) %}
I aim to build tools that foster an era of sustainable humanity and prosperity
for all those whose lives will follow.

This is my website about data engineering, business intelligence, AI, and
generally my work as a data management specialist. This is also home to ***[the
spacebar](spacebar)***, my mostly serious blog related to programming, Linux,
math, and the occasional directed or undirected rant.
{% end %}

Welcome. I hope that you enjoy your stay.

## about

I am a data and software engineer with a background in mathematics from
Northwestern University. I harbor a deep love of computers, mathematical
elegance, functional simplicity, and the common wealth of knowledge that humans
have amassed through our impressive era on Planet Earth.

I also really like Linux. You will (eventually) find a lot of posts about it, as
I hope to share some of my experiences dealing with some setbacks and
compromises that come with the freedom that Linux affords over the past
near-decade of my using the platform in its various flavors. Head over to ***[the
spacebar](spacebar)*** for the latest content (try sorting through tags).
