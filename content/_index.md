## Hi, I'm Bailey Bjornstad

{% image_homeprofile(path="img/bjornstad-profile-square.jpg", width=430) %}
I aim to build tools that foster an era of sustainable humanity and prosperity
for all beings whose lives are set to follow.

This is a website about data engineering, business, intelligence, AI, and
generally my work as a data management specialist. This is also home to **_[the
spacebar](spacebar)_**, a mostly serious blog related to programming, Linux,
math, getting through life with minimal damage, and the occasional directed or
undirected rant.
{% end %}

Welcome. I hope that you enjoy your stay.

### About

I am a data and software engineer with a background in mathematics from
Northwestern University. I harbor a deep love of computers, mathematical
elegance, functional simplicity, and the common wealth of knowledge that humans
have amassed through our impressive, and sometimes messy era on Planet Earth. I
enjoy solving problems, and probably think too much about the intrinsic meaning
of existence.

I also love Linux, open-source software, evidence-based action to improve
humanity, and empowering common people to enact lasting positive change through
their lives by removing barriers that stand in the way of these goals. I believe
in the power of a free and open internet, accessible to all. It is through the
free dissemination of knowledge that our collective understanding of this weird
world (and the people in it) has been most enriched. In this version of our
world, all can learn from the cultural and experiential diversity that, at the
time of this writing, is withheld for only the most elite amongst the social
ranks. I think it is applicable to say that this is an opinionated place. Head
over to **_[the spacebar](spacebar)_** for the latest content (try sorting
through tags).

### Bulletin -- News, Announcements

You are on the first version of this website. Minor bugs are likely to be
expected while the full site structure is fleshed out. Please [contact
me](contact) if you would like to report a bug or new issue with this site's
operation. Hopefully these are minimal, as this is a static site. Dynamic
content here might mean you've ended up in a corner of the internet you didn't
mean to reach.
