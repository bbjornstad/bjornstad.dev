## In Google's Best Interest

Let's just say that pretty much nothing Google does will be in your best
interest. This has become abundantly clear after it has come to light that they
have crippled the internet with their relentless desire to extract every last ad
dollar imaginable from their products and user interfaces (before the C-Suite
prematurely kills them anyhow).

I say, it's high time they get left in the dust. Future prospects for a
deGoogled life look better every day. Ancient proverbs, wise and old, say that
the most valuable thing you can give is your time--so let's aim to give Google
none of it.

Their reach, alas, is too widespread across all facets of life for this to
currently realized. Fight the war, not the battle (also from the proverbs).
