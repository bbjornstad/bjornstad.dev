__I think these things are neat__

A collection of links and items that I think are fascinating, useful, or fun.
Some of these are things that I use daily, others might be things I happened
upon once, that I guess I decided seemed worth sharing.

Is it more like a graveyard or an archive? This is left as an exercise to the
reader.
