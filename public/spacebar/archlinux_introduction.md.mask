I've always been of the opinion that the most ideal forms encountered in life
are the simplest. A lot of my favorite music is devilishly simple, the kind of
thing that makes you wonder how you didn't come up with such sounds yourself. In
nature, water follows the path of least resistance, as does electricity, or
some might say humanity. We cannot forget Occam, whose razor seems to be
gliding closer to our skin with each passing day, or perhaps that's just what
becoming older feels like.

Enter Arch Linux. I was a freshman in college, fresh off the back of a
demoralizing experience trying to get FedEx to reimburse me for their damages to
my desktop computer they incurred during transit to Evanston. It just so happened that Murphy also decided to rear
his ugly head that day. A myriad of issues had sprung up with the computer. The sound was completely trashed, there were several driver related errors that cropped up during the debugging phase,
sporadic boot behavior, graphical glitches...

I had been fed up with Microsoft's lousy attempt at an operating system for
several years by this point. And I suppose this was the straw that broke the
camel's back. Enough was enough, if windows didn't want to play
nice with my hardware, I was in no position to make concessions to microsoft on
this front. So I dumped them, I left Windows behind and I never looked back. And
that was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

## Arch Linux

I suppose it was a natural choice, settling on Arch Linux. I had some experience
with various other linux distributions through jobs in high school or just for
fun discovery and learning. But, I never really clicked with any of them all
that well. Linux Mint, nor Ubuntu, nor CentOS really inspired me. Being a bit of
a control freak, especially when it comes to my technology, the ethos behind the
Arch Linux project was very appealing. KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid.

In the wake of my headaches with windows, maybe I placed too much value on this
fact alone, but it was a decision that I made consciously, realizing the
alternative value in the ability to access free and open software. If only the
installation process could be so simple too. 

I think it took me 4 full days before I had my first booting images created.
That does not include any time to configure user applications, which can also
eat up large chunks of time. I probably repeated the installation 10x times,
realizing each time that there was another small value I forgot to set, that I need
to add boot menu entries, or set particular kernel parameters in order to eek
out those extra few features that I wanted (not to mention wholesale swaths of
packages that need to be ported).

It has now been nearly 10 years since my first installation--dubbed Andromeda,
after the closest galaxy to the Milky Way, and for her role in the legends of
humans past. In that time I have managed to get my installation time down to
within a day. Even still, there's always something I forget. I don't think I've
ever successfully installed Arch Linux on the first try.
